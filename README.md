# InhertanceConstructor
    
/**
 * In this challenge, you will be asked to build on an abstract class and initialize an instance
 * of each class with a variable. The program will then test your implementation by retrieving the
 * data you stored.
 * 
 * Complete the code in the editor below to implement the following:
 * 1. Three classes named Dog, Cow, and Duck that inherit from the Animal class.
 * 2. Constructors for each class that initialize the instance variables 
 *    inherited from the superclass.
 * 3. Each class must implement the getGreeting() method:
 *    a. For a Dog object, this must return the String ruff
 *    b. For a Cow object, this must return the String moo
 *    c. For a Duck object, this must return the String quack.
